# Simulacroom

## About

This is a webpage based on a grid layout that is 3D transformed to appear isometric. I will try to represent all 3 planes of 3D isometric space in the same way, and place objects on the "surfaces." I'll try this first with simple css grid and transforms, and if this doesn't work will move to threeJS. The purpose is be a simulacrum of a room, with surfaces that are captured by a camera, processes images of those surfaces periodically, and "paints" the surface of this webpage with that image.

## Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Vanilla): No frameworks, just core web tech.
- CSS Grid & 3D Transforms: For layout and isometric effect.
- Optional: Use a lightweight image capture library if you want to simulate camera input, or just use static images for now.
- No build tools or frameworks (no React, Vue, etc.)
- No backend (unless you want to add live camera support later)
Just open index.html in your browser to run
